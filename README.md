# RSA Encryption Tool

This project implements a simple RSA encryption tool in C++ to demonstrate the basic concepts of RSA encryption and decryption using number theory.

## Overview

The RSA encryption algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem that uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers.

## Features

- **Prime Number Generation**: Generate random prime numbers within a specified range.
- **Public and Private Key Generation**: Create public and private keys for encryption and decryption.
- **Message Encryption**: Encrypt a message using the public key.
